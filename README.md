# SharedIO
When this is done this will be an implementation of the Community Exchange API

That is, a JSON Api for running a mutual credit exchange based on agreed assets.

There is no UI for this API, strictly back end. This implementation is built on RavenDB. 

Would be nice to correspond to http://jsonapi.org/ conventions, to make it easier to build front ends.
